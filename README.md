# CosmicLoader

Allows the ability to mod with fabric mods on Cosmic Reach. Works flawlessly with Mixin-Extras.

Thanks to FowarD-NerN for getting this started would not have been possible without him. A link to his 
original repository [CosmicReach-Example-Mod](https://github.com/ForwarD-NerN/CosmicReach-Example-Mod).
